Herman AKUE is a certified professional tourism guide specializing in West Africa, with deep expertise in Benin, Togo, and Ghana. Born in Cotonou and raised in Grand-Popo, a historic Beninese city rich in culture and heritage, Herman grew up with his feet in the sand, immersed in the fascinating history of Benin.

After completing his baccalaureate in Grand-Popo, Herman pursued tourism studies at the Higher School of Commerce and Management (HECM) in Cotonou. His passion for his country and its neighbors naturally led him to make tourism his profession. With university training and professional qualifications, he was honored to be selected as a national professional guide.

Today, Herman shares his time between the hidden treasures of Benin, the natural wonders of Togo, and the cultural richness of Ghana. Every day is a new adventure, an opportunity to help visitors discover the authenticity of these destinations and provide unforgettable experiences.

His mission is simple: to show you West Africa as he knows and loves it, with its breathtaking landscapes, vibrant traditions, and the warmth of its people.
