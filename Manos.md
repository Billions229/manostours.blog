My Story  Herman AKUE 

Born in Cotonou and raised in Grand-Popo, a Beninese city steeped in history and culture, I had the chance to grow up with my feet in the sand, lulled by the history of Benin. It was here, on the school benches, that I obtained my baccalaureate, with a growing curiosity for the world around me.

My love for Benin, Togo and Ghana is much more than simple professional expertise. It is the reflection of a life, a childhood and a passion that has matured over time.

After high school, I settled in Cotonou where I studied tourism at the Higher School of Commerce and Management (HECM). It was obvious: I wanted to make my passion for my country and its neighbors my profession. With university training and professional qualification, I had the honor of being selected as a national professional guide.

Today, I share my time between the hidden treasures of Benin, the natural wonders of Togo and the cultural richness of Ghana. Every day is a new adventure, an opportunity to help you discover the authenticity of these destinations and to give you unforgettable experiences.

My ambition is simple: to show you West Africa as I know and love it, with its breathtaking landscapes, vibrant traditions and the warmth of its people.
